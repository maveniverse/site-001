All the Maveniverse projects were built with well-defined purpose and goal: to help and guide Apache Maven users.

Maveniverse umbrella started as a "laboratory" for fast-paced prototyping and experimenting, but also to host
projects that Apache Maven project felt as inadequate to host at project itself.

The idea of Maveniverse is to serve as "skunk works" around Maven with quick turnaround and prototyping, but 
at the same provide clear passage for projects from Apache Maven to here, but other way around as well (once
community deems project as "mature"). Given most of us are Apache Maven committers, or Apache Maven PMC members,
we want Apache Maven to prosper.
