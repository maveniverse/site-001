In short: you want to use it for proper local repository maintenance, but it also helps with disk space usage as well,
and real workstation wide caching, irrelevant of how many local repositories you use. Finally, if you workstation-hop
a lot (like I do) on same LAN, it makes pretty much sense to pick up on new workstation where you left off on
old workstation.
