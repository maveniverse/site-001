Lately has been toying with IPFS to achieve content sharing without centralized infrastructure. In other words, instead
to free-ride on some (centralized) infrastructure that may be a public good, or some commercial offering, solve the publishing
(and also "owning" and "hosting" the data) by my self. Kinda reminded me this to early 2000s, when many ran 
Maven repositories in their own basements, making access to their repositories fragile, with longevity accessibility
and uptimes totally unpredictable. That was before Central, which consolidated but also promoted itself as single point of
failure. And hence, ended up as over- and misused, see [Maven Central and the Tragedy of the Commons](https://www.sonatype.com/blog/maven-central-and-the-tragedy-of-the-commons).
